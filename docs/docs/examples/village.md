[osm3DMamre_param.json](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/geo3D/blob/main/village/osm3DMamre_param.json) defines the settings to produce a CityJSON 3D City Model of a rural village with an approximate population of 9 000 (2150 buildings). 

`runtime: 0:03:46` with a 25-m elevation model and `0:14:55` with a 10-m elevation model.

[interactiveOnly.ipynb](https://github.com/AdrianKriger/geo3D/blob/main/village/interactiveOnly.ipynb) is a walk-through for the production of a dynamic `.html`, of the same area, with additional visual features and an application of Spatial Data Science.
